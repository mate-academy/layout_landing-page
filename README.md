- About project
  A sophisticated e-commerce website for Bang & Olufsen, the renowned Danish premium audio brand. The project showcases the company's high-end audio equipment and smart home products through an elegant, minimalistic Scandinavian design approach.
  The site features a clean layout with abundant white space, emphasizing product photography and the brand's "Your senses. Set free." philosophy. Key sections include a curated product recommendations area highlighting items like the BEOSOUND A5 portable speaker, BEOPLAY HX wireless headphones, and BEOSOUND THEATRE soundbar.
  The design employs a strategic product categorization system covering Portable speakers, Earphones, and Smart Home devices. The layout maintains visual hierarchy through typography and spacing, while the neutral color palette of whites, grays, and blacks allows the products to take center stage.
  The bottom section emphasizes the brand's heritage with "Timeless, for 50 years and counting" messaging, reinforcing Bang & Olufsen's legacy in premium audio engineering and Danish design excellence.
