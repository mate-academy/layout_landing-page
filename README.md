# Landing page
The landing page is created using HTML, SCSS, and BEM to showcase a product or service. The page's structure is divided into blocks, each serving a specific function. Each block has a unique name following the BEM methodology, which helps avoid conflicts and maintains the CSS structure.

The code is written using the SCSS preprocessor, enabling the use of variables for quick style parameter changes. Additionally, with the nesting of styles, the code becomes more readable and easier to maintain.
