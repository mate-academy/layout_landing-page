- Start writing styles in the `main.scss` file. It is be explained in the `Sass` lesson
- **DON'T** try to do it `Pixel Perfect` - implement it the most `simple` way so it looks similar;
- When done check yourself using the [CHECKLIST](./checklist.md) when finished;
- Deploy and create a Pull Request with a [DEMO LINK](https://00Mass00.github.io/layout_landing-page/)

# Tips & Hints
- Check `background-image: url()` to be relative to the `main.scss`. So should start with `../images`.
- If some points from the checklist are not relevant to your design, just skip it.
