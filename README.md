This project is a web design for Bang & Olufsen (B&O), featuring a clean and modern layout that showcases their products and brand identity. The webpage includes:
- Main page: Contains the B&O logo, phone number, and menu icons. The phone number is designed to appear on hover over the phone icon, with a transition effect applied.
- Sidebar menu: Accessible via the menu icon, it includes navigation links, a phone number, and a call-to-order option.
- Recommended products: Highlights key products with images, titles, descriptions, and prices.
- Categories: Presents different product categories like Portable Speakers, Earphones, and Smart Home with visual links.
- Information about company: Details B&Oâ€™s history and the launch of their Beosystems as part of their Recreated Classics Program.
- Contacts: Provides contact information including phone, email, and address.
The project is built using HTML, which provides the structure and content of the web page. It includes semantic elements like <header>, <main>, and <section>. The styling is managed through a SCSS file. Sass allows for advanced features like variables, nesting, and mixins, which make the CSS more maintainable and modular.
