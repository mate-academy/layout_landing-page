For the landing page, I chose the design:
- [MET landing](https://www.figma.com/file/lSR1m42L9YwzQwzzxKwHpw/THE-MET)

At the initial stage, I created blocks related to the main page and the menu. The landing was created using the Sass  preprocessor with BEM.

When checking at this stage, please pay attention only to the main page and the menu.
