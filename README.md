# Landing page

This project is a website for a bicycle brand named "MyBiKE.". This is a well-structured and visually appealing website with sections for showcasing the brand, products, features, and facilitating user interaction through contact options.


The technologies used in this project include:

1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language):
Used for structuring the content and defining the layout of the web pages.

2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
Responsible for styling and formatting the visual presentation of the HTML content.

3. SCSS (Sass):
An extension of CSS that adds features like variables and nested rules, making the stylesheets more maintainable.

4. JavaScript:
Used for adding interactivity to the website. The main JavaScript file (main.js) is linked with the HTML document.

5. Google Fonts:
The website imports the "Poppins" font from Google Fonts to enhance the typography.

6. Responsive Design:
Media queries in the CSS styles are likely used for creating a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

These technologies collectively contribute to the structure, style, and interactivity of the "MyBiKE" website, providing a visually appealing and functional user experience.
