# Landing Page

- [MYBIKE landing](https://www.figma.com/file/NZQAIydtHo5QkINyGLHNcq/BIKE-New-Version?node-id=0%3A1)

This page is created for a company specializing in bicycle sales. It is adapted for different devices to ensure a convenient browsing experience for users. The page includes a navigation menu that allows users to jump to specific sections, as well as interactive buttons that provide visual feedback when clicked.

In this project, I used HTML, CSS, and SCSS. The page incorporates technologies such as Grid, Flexbox, animations, and many other features to enhance the design and user experience.
