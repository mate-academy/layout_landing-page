# Landing page

- For training purposes, a landing page was made according to the proposed design for the NOTHING company's products.

- HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript were used in the work.

- Also, images from the company's official website were used to prepare images and were processed using Photoshop.

- The main image has been replaced with another one (from the official website).
