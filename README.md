# Landing page

This project is the landing page of an online bicycle store. In the process of its creation, both flex and grid technologies were used, where appropriate. Also, the page is filled with various animated elements, including zoomed photos, hover shadows, pull-down menu with navigation, fixed footer. In addition, a feedback form has been created and the possibility to call, send an email or simply view the location on the map has been implemented.
It is also worth noting that the landing page is adapted for different devices, so it will always be convenient and easy to use.
