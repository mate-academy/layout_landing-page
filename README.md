# Project Landing Page - "MyBike"
A small project where a landing page with bicycles was implemented - MyBike. The page contains several blocks, in particular, a header, main part and footer. A menu has also been implemented that contains links to the corresponding blocks in the landing page. For bicycle cards, as well as for pictures with details, a hover animation has been added that increases the zoom. For the logo, a sway animation has been added, and for the icons (phone and menu) a zoom animation has been added.
