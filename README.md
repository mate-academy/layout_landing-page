# Landing Page

# Short Desctiption

Its a web site related for promoting and selling brand new bikes under company MyBike (pet project).


# Technologies

Here I used basic CSS technologies, such as:

1. SCSS - for better grouping of elements and highclass SASS and BEM expieience.

2. Transitions and animations. I used transitions and animations to upgrade userexpirience and make landing more interesting.

3. Mixins. To follow DRY rule, I used it for unique code readability.
