# Description

During execution, the BEM methodology was used.

To build the header of the site, the semantic tags header and nav were used. For the content: main, section and article. For the bottom of the site: footer, form, section, article.

To adapt to different devices, media queries were used.

For styling, the SASS preprocessor was used: creating changes, mixins and working with nested classes.

Also used were such display methods as: flex, grid, and various ways of positioning elements in blocks: relative and absolute.

In addition, for smooth changes, transition-duration was set, and to change the elements themselves, transform properties were used.
