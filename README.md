# Landing Page

I implemented a landing page about bicycles. It contains a hidden menu with navigation that appears on the left, a header with a title, a logo, and icons. This is followed by a short abstract, then a comparison of three bicycle models. Next, there are details about the features of these bicycles, followed by a short feedback form, and at the very bottom, a sticky footer.

I used technologies such as SCSS, BEM, CSS Grid, Flexbox, CSS transformations, npm, Git, and GitHub.
