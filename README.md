# Landing page

> Made for Mate Academy Task. Topic **Landing**.

The main goal of this project was to practice new skills I learned during Mate Academy courses.
To be more specific, I was focusing on understanding BEM technology, mastering SCSS preprocessor and responsive design.

There still might be some issues with the layout, but it works fine and smooth.
