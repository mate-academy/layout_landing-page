- Comments:
  - Hided phone number tooltip for mobile version, because it collapsed with logo after clicking on phone icon.
  - Replaced grid to margins for gaps between sections, because these gaps are not the same on each of the designs (mobile, tablet, desktop).
  - Used at my own discretion colors for contacts links hovers, because on the design didn't find information about these colors.
  - On tablet designs, sizes of logo and icons on header and menu are different (applied header sizes for menu).
