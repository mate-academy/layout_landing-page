It's a study project: a landing page for the Bang & Olufsen company. It represents the skills I adopted during the first two weeks of studying at Mate Academy in creating layouts using HTML and CSS. It has all the basic web page elements such as header, navigation, main content with sections, footer, and form.
There is an implemented BEM methodology for classes.
A Sass preprocessor was used for styling.
