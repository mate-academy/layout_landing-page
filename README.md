DESCRIPTION

This website is a landing page showcasing a museum. The page contains main sections such as "Plan your visit," "Now On View," "More to explore online," and "Contact us." These sections provide information about opening hours, current exhibitions, online programs, and contact details.

TECHNOLOGIES

The page is built using HTML and CSS, with various classes and pseudo-elements utilized for styling and organizing content. Media queries and a well-thought-out HTML structure are employed to ensure responsiveness and usability. Mixins and variables in SCSS are actively used for convenient style organization and management. Additionally, text transformation and user interaction responses are implemented. The <div class="container"> element in this landing is not part of BEM but is used to limit the width in all sections as a DOM element. Through the contentPaddingInline mixin, it provides adaptive margins relative to the screen size, increasing them for different devices.
