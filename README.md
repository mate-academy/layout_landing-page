# THE MET landing page
In this project, I applied my practical skills of **HTML** and **CSS**:
- BEM rules were followed;
- Elements on the page were positioned by using Flexbox and Grid.
- I used SCSS to improve the styling of my page.
- Parcel was used to build the project and compile SCSS with CSS.
- I used a project structure which based on grouping elements into components.
- Mixins were used to make the page responsive.
- I used variables to make my code clear.
- I followed the “Don’t repeat yourself rule”.
- Animations and transformations were added to make the page more interactive.
