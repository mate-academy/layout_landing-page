- A page for the MYBike website was developed. The site specialises in selling bicycles.

- The site was developed according to the layout: (https://www.figma.com/design/NZQAIydtHo5QkINyGLHNcq/BIKE-New-Version?node-id=41317-96&t=x7ZvE8YTsqLgZDQB-0).
- [DEMO LINK](https://R-Ohirok.github.io/layout_landing-page/).

- It was developed using HTML and CSS technologies.
- The solution was implemented using BEM, SASS methodologies.

The layout does not have a colour when hovering over the link in the 'Contact us' block, so it was decided to use the 'aquamarine' colour.
