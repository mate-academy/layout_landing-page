The project is the website of the "Nothing" online store. It is a minimalistic and visually appealing website with sections to showcase the brand, products, and facilitate user interaction with contact details. 

Technologies used in this project include:

1. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):
Used to structure content and define the layout of web pages.

2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
Responsible for styling and formatting the visual representation of HTML content.

3. SCSS (Sass):
An extension of CSS that adds features such as variables and nested rules, making style sheets more maintainable.

4. Responsive design:
Media queries in CSS styles are likely used to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

5. Google Fonts:
The website imports the "Space Mono" and "Space Grotesk" fonts from Google Fonts to enhance the typography.

Together, these technologies influence the structure, style and interactivity of the "Bose" website, providing a visually appealing and functional user experience.
