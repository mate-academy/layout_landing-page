# Landing page

I'm presenting you a landing page of a promotional Bike store web site.
It is developed using BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) component-based approach and advanced scss styling capabilities.
The 'menu' icon in the top right corner of the page opens a pop-up navigation menu.
The main part of the page consists of four sections, telling the potential customer about the different types of bikes.
At the bottom of the page, there is a form asking him to submit a purchase request.
The whole page is made in a trendy dark a la minimalistic theme.

You can find the mockup here:
