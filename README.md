### ðŸ”¹ Short Project Description
This is a landing page project developed as part of a course assignment, based on a provided design. The main goal was to practice layout building, SCSS structuring, and responsive design. I created a fully responsive page using modern layout techniques like CSS Grid and followed the BEM methodology for class naming.

### The page includes the following sections:

- `Header` with a `Top-bar` and a `Nav` block;

- `Menu` (reusing the same `Top-bar`);

- `Main` with sections: `Hours`, `Now` include a `View` block, `More`, `Contact`;

- `Footer`.

### ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- **HTML5** â€” for page structure;

- **CSS3 / SCSS** â€” for styling, mixins, nesting, and variables;

- **BEM** â€” for consistent class naming;

- **CSS Grid / Flexbox** â€” for layout and positioning;

- **Mobile-first responsive design** â€” optimized first for mobile, then adapted for tablets and desktops;

- **Git / GitHub** â€” for version control and project hosting;

- **VS Code** â€” main development environment;

- **GitHub Pages** â€” for deployment;

- **Node.js** â€” included in the project setup (scripts were provided by the course, not written by me).
