# Landing page

- I made the website of the museum. The site has a header, menu with navigation, four sections and footer.
- During development, I use:
- - SASS preprocessor;
- - BEM methodology;
- - used grid and flex to place elements;
- - used transition for smooth increase of icons and pictures as links on hover.

- - The mockup and demo are below.
