# Landing page
Hello, world!

Here is my project [Nothing](https://AndreaTkachuk.github.io/layout_landing-page/).

And here is [the design from Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/DtkQmQ797hk0nI4KfMi2Uq/BOSE-New-Version?node-id=6802-139&node-type=canvas&t=XTVVj9pNvf5Fi0sb-0) for this project.

I used some technologies from the previous lessons, like:
 - positions on the page
 - pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements
 - display flex, grid
 - mixins
 - variables
 - and so on ...
