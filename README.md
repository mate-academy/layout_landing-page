# MYBIKE -  Store

I have created a modern and responsive landing page dedicated to bicycles. The main goal was to make it user-friendly, visually appealing, and smooth to interact with.

On the left side of the screen, there’s a hidden navigation menu that smoothly slides out when needed. The header contains the site’s title, logo, and action icons.

After that comes a short introduction, followed by a comparison block where users can explore three bicycle models with their descriptions and prices. For those who want more details, I included a dedicated specifications section.

To make the experience more dynamic, I implemented a subtle page-load animation where the entire layout slightly pulls upward when the site opens.

At the bottom, there’s a feedback form and a sticky footer that always remains visible. I also added a convenient “Back to Top” button in the lower-left corner, allowing users to instantly return to the top of the page at any time.
