The Met landing page
## Features & Technical Details
In this project, I used the following technologies and techniques to enhance the user experience and improve code maintainability:

- **CSS Grid**: I utilized CSS Grid layout to create a flexible and responsive design. This allowed me to control the layout of the page more efficiently, ensuring that elements adapt to different screen sizes.

- **CSS Animations with `transform`**: I implemented animations using the `transform` property, which allowed me to create smooth, interactive transitions for elements on the page. I also practiced using a fixed `transition-duration` to control the timing of these animations for a more predictable user experience.

- **Flexbox**: Flexbox was used to arrange elements in a more efficient way, especially for components that needed alignment and spacing within their parent containers.

- **BEM Methodology**: The BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology was employed to structure my CSS classes in a more modular and maintainable way. This helped ensure that the code is scalable and easy to read.

- **SCSS Syntax**: I wrote the styles using SCSS, which offers enhanced features over regular CSS such as variables, nested selectors, and mixins. This made my stylesheets more readable, reusable, and easier to maintain.

- **Icon Animations with `hover` Effects**: I applied CSS animations to the icons with `hover` effects for decoration, providing visual feedback to users when they interact with the icons. This added a playful and engaging touch to the interface.

- **Smooth Navigation**: I incorporated smooth transitions for navigation between pages or sections of the website, enhancing the overall user experience by making the site feel more responsive and fluid.
