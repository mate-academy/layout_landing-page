This is my first more or less large project, where I created a landing page for a bicycle site. On this landing page, you can navigate between blocks in the menu that opens when you click on the menu icon. There are several blocks in total: about us, bicycle comparison, details and contacts. This landing page is also configured to run on smaller screen sizes, such as a phone or tablet. When creating this landing page, technologies such as HTML, CSS, and CSS were used.
