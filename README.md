# Landing page

Choose a design for your landing page:
- [MYBIKE landing](https://www.figma.com/file/NZQAIydtHo5QkINyGLHNcq/BIKE-New-Version?node-id=0%3A1)

Follow the videos in this and next lessons to implement the page block by block
- Here is [the design from the video](https://www.figma.com/file/DtkQmQ797hk0nI4KfMi2Uq/BOSE-New-Version?type=design&node-id=6703-88&t=L7eKz5YKLN0m5WxR-0)
- Start writing styles in the `main.scss` file. It is be explained in the `Sass` lesson
- **DON'T** try to do it `Pixel Perfect` - implement it the most `simple` way so it looks similar;
- When done check yourself using the [CHECKLIST](./checklist.md) when finished;
- Deploy and create a Pull Request with a [DEMO LINK](https://okanivan.github.io/layout_landing-page/)

# Tips & Hints
- Check `background-image: url()` to be relative to the `main.scss`. So should start with `../images`.
- If some points from the checklist are not relevant to your design, just skip it.
