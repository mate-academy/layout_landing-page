// I didn`t find changed color for phone, email and address
// so I decided this point (checklist 4) doesn`t relevant to my design.

//I changed back-ground-color from checklist`s point 12 to other color.
// Hope that`s not a problem :)

// I didn`t understand checklist`s point 16.
// I mean how it need to looks like, so I just added
// position:sticky and z-index: -1

// And should it be block with second part of menu?
// Cos there is with first - "nav".
// It was on video lesson, but why? We dont reuse it.
// And in this case do we need to do blocks for everything?
// Same for contacts section...
// there could be two blocks - contacts and form, but we dont reuse them

//Also I guess to make paddings almost for all elements is wrong way.
// It should be optimized somehow, but I have no idea.
//There is low photo on figma mockup (now-on-view section,
// second from end photo)

//PLS, tell me my mixins fantastic
